Sharparam.Scroller
==================

A game (well, soon^(TM) to be) made with SFML and Tiled (using TiledSharp).

The current state of the code is **very messy** as I'm testing various things to see what works.

The goal is to get a nice code-base that can be used as a starting point for future games and a possibly a simplistic 2D engine.
